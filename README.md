If you want to use this module for your projects you should follow the next steps:

* You should create a new **'libs'** folder in your project root
* You should copy this project into the **'libs'** folder, you must manually copy the project, because if you copy        it using the drag and drop action the project doesn't work  because android studio throw an error
* Add the next line into settings.gradle file:
   **include ':libs:facebook'**
* You should **rebuild the project**

### THAT'S IT!
